# My Dance Studio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://agitated-bhaskara-e98250.netlify.app/).

.Here i use react-router. React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. I also used react-fontawosome,react-bootstrape.

.In navbar i have showed 4 “pages” handled by the router: a home page, an about page, a services page,a contact page. As you click around on the different <Link>s, the router renders the matching <Route>

.This is a dance studio website where you can use this templates any other site's design.
